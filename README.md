# Dynamic text replacement for Rails

This was made for a project that required headers in a custom font. At that time webfonts were still a novelty and I decided to resort to [dynamic text replacement](http://alistapart.com/article/dynatext), that is, rendering the string in custom font as an image and inserting it into the page with CSS.

I don't think this has any practical use in 2014, but I'm still putting it up for posterity.
